# Match Three Game

This repository contains a browser-based match-three game built with `p5.js`.

- Play the game locally by opening `docs/index.html` in a browser.
- Once GitHub Pages is enabled for the `docs/` directory, the game will be available online: [Play Match Three](docs/index.html).

## Development

To experiment locally, run a simple static server from the project root (for example `python3 -m http.server`) and visit `http://localhost:8000/docs/`.
